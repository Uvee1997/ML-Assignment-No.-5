Quantitative data includes distance in miles, age in year while        qualitative data expressed by describing or labeling certain attributes. "

    "      Exploring categorical variables is generally simpler than working with numeric variables because we have fewer             options, or at least life is simpler if we only require basic summaries. We’ll work with the year and type variables       in storms to illustrate the key ideas. Which kind of categorical variable is type? There are four storm categories in       type. We can use the unique function to print these for us:\n",

    "      \n",
    "      This illustrates an important idea: the classification of a variable will often depend on the objectives of an             analysis. The classification of a variable matters because it influences how we choose to summarise it, how we             interpret its relationship with other variables, and whether a specific statistical model is appropriate for our data       or not. Fortunately, our choice of classification is less important when we are just trying to summarise the variable       numerically or graphically. For now, let’s assume that it’s fine to treat year as a categorical variable.\n",

    "   ii) Numerical summaries -\n",
    "       When we calculate summaries of categorical variables we are aiming to describe the sample distribution of the              variable, just as with numeric variables. We need to understand which categories are common and which are rare.            Since a categorical variable takes a finite number of possible values, the simplest thing to do is tabulate the            number of occurances of each type. "

    "\n",
    "   Missing at Random means the data is missing relative to the observed data. It is not related to the specific missing        values. The data is not missing across all observations but only within sub-samples of the data. It is not known if the    data should be there; instead, it is missing given the observed data. The missing data can be predicted based on the        complete observed data\n",
    "\n",
    "   Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)-\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In the MCAR situation, the data is missing across all observations regardless of the expected value or other variables.    Data scientists can compare two sets of data, one with missing observations and one without. Using a t-test, if there is    no difference between the two data sets, the data is characterized as MCAR.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Missing Not at Random (MNAR)-\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The MNAR category applies when the missing data has a structure to it. In other words, there appear to be reasons the      data is missing. In a survey, perhaps a specific group of people – say women ages 45 to 55 – did not answer a question.    Like MAR, the data cannot be determined by the observed data, because the missing information is unknown.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   Listwise-\n",
    "   In this method, all data for an observation that has one or more missing values are deleted. The analysis is run only on    observations that have a complete set of data. If the data set is small, it may be the most efficient method to            eliminate those cases from the analysis. However, in most cases, the data are not missing completely at random (MCAR).      Deleting the instances with missing observations can result in biased parameters and estimates and reduce the              statistical power of the analysis. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Pairwise-\n",
